# My Community Center List

There are a lot of existing community center lists out there, but I always had a few nitpicks with all of them

For my this project, my goal is to have the following features:

- UI-wise have it have the same aesthetic as Stardew Valley (Done)
- Automatically crosses off items you don't need to collect anymore (Done)
- Multiplayer Support (Multiple people can edit the same list at once) (Done)
- Easy to Read/Mobile friendly (To Do)
